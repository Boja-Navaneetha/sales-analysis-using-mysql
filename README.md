# sales analysis using mysql



#### 🚀 **Objective**

To explore and analyze sales data through advanced SQL queries, revealing key patterns in customer behavior, product performance, shipping preferences, and revenue generation.



#### 🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**

* **SQL** – Core language for data manipulation and querying
* **MySQL / SQL Server / PostgreSQL** – Compatible RDBMS
* **DB Client (e.g., MySQL Workbench / DBeaver)** – For executing and testing queries


#### 🧭 **Workflow & Key Steps**

1. **Database Setup** – Create and switch to the `company` database
2. **Data Exploration** – Examine the structure and contents of the `sales` table
3. **Filtering & Conditions** – Extract data based on shipping mode, product category, geography, and dates
4. **Aggregation & Metrics** – Calculate totals, averages, and counts using SQL functions
5. **Sorting & Ranking** – Identify top performers using `ORDER BY` and `RANK()`
6. **Pattern Matching** – Search for names and products using `LIKE` expressions
7. **Grouping & Insights** – Summarize data by city, customer, and product



#### 📈 **Analytical Focus Areas**

* 📦 High-value orders shipped via **Economy mode**
* 🖥️ Technology sales in **Ireland** after 2020
* 💰 Top 10 **most profitable** orders
* 👤 Customers with specific naming patterns
* 🏙️ Cities with **highest total sales**
* 📊 Revenue summaries, unit cost averages, and total orders
* 🏆 Product rankings based on total sales volume



#### 🔍 **Key Insights**

* Major revenue comes from specific cities and customer segments
* High-profit orders often follow identifiable patterns
* Certain product categories consistently outperform others
* Valuable trends emerge from customer purchase behaviors



#### ✅ **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how **SQL** can transform raw datasets into meaningful business intelligence. By leveraging structured queries, we uncover deep insights that can inform strategic decisions in real-world commerce scenarios.
